                    <p>
                        Media literacy allows us to interact with the media and to be active citizens. The European Commission supports the exchange of best practices on media literacy and fosters networking among stakeholders.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Media literacy refers to all the technical, cognitive, social, civic and creative capacities that allow us to access and have a critical understanding of and interact with media. These capacities allow us to exercise critical thinking, while participating in the economic, social and cultural aspects of society and playing an active role in the democratic process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Media literacy is also a tool that can empower citizens, raise their awareness and support a critical approach to online content to help counter the effects of disinformation campaigns and fake news in todayâ€™s digital media landscape.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It covers different media: broadcasting, radio, press, through various channels: traditional, internet, social media and addresses the needs of all ages.
